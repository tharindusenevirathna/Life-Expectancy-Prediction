# Life Expectancy Prediction Project

This project aims to predict life expectancy using a linear regression model trained on health and socioeconomic data. Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations, the project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to predict life expectancy based on a range of influential factors.

## Project Overview

Life expectancy is influenced by various factors including adult mortality, infant deaths, healthcare expenditure, and lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption. By accurately predicting life expectancy, we can better understand the impact of these factors on public health. This project leverages linear regression to create a predictive model, with potential applications in policy planning and healthcare analysis.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will learn to:

- **Evaluate Regression Models:** Use different metrics to assess the performance of regression models.
- **Analyze Regression KPIs:** Understand key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R², and Adjusted R².
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Build, train, and evaluate a linear regression model using the Scikit-Learn library.
- **Data Standardization:** Prepare data by standardizing features for optimal model performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights and visualize relationships between features.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
   - Feature Standardization
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization

2. **Model Building**  
   - Train a Linear Regression Model using Scikit-Learn
   - Evaluate the Model using KPIs (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R², and Adjusted R²)

3. **Model Evaluation and Visualization**  
   - Compare actual vs. predicted life expectancy
   - Visualize the performance of the best model

## Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:
- **Year:** The year of data collection.
- **Status:** The economic status of the country (developing or developed).
- **Life Expectancy:** The target variable.
- **Adult Mortality:** Adult mortality rate.
- **Infant Deaths:** Number of infant deaths.
- **Percentage Expenditure:** Government expenditure on healthcare.
- **Alcohol Consumption:** Alcohol consumption per capita, etc.

## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.7)
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn



## Conclusion

This project provides an overview of how linear regression can be applied to health-related data for predictive modeling. By evaluating various KPIs, we can assess the model's effectiveness and gain insights into the factors impacting life expectancy.
